Excellent at the beginning

Disappointing at the end tbh. Seems like the author runs out of energy and just dishing keywords to be filled later (?!?)

Authentication/authorization is an important concept but he shows snippets here and there and tons of descriptions of other things.

"Admin" table should be doing this and that, "Permission", "Role", "RoleTable" so and so. But zero code, only 1-2 sentences each. 

"Production" chapter only links you to other books and documentations (?!?)
